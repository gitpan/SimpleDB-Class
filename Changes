0.0501 2009-12-29
 - Wasn't setting replace on attributes, updates kept adding them over and over again.

0.0500 2009-12-29
 - Added support for triggers on item attributes.
 - Added update(), delete(), and search() to result sets.
 - Note that to make the search() work on result sets, an id field is automatically added to every domain. This unfortunately means that existing domains that don't have an id field populated with the id of the item aren't compatible with the search() method on the result set.

0.0400 - 2009-12-28
 - Added support for HashRef field types in Items. Note that JSONified they cannot exceed 1024 characters.
 - Now supports 15 digit positive integers and 9 digit negative integers.
 - Added a couple tests to make sure attribute methods are created.
 - Fixed some documentation bugs.
 - Fixed a bug with a the retry timer in SimpleDB::Class::HTTP, where it would hang.

0.0300 - 2009-12-20
 - Rethought the whole subclassing approach. Now subclassing the result rather than the domain, and everything is much cooler, and is much closer to DBIx::Class. Check out the docs for API changes.
 - While rewriting discovered that all relationship and attribute methods were global (all classes in the schema got them), which is a huge bug. This problemhas been eliminated in this version as well.
 - Added Sub::Name to the prereqs.

0.0201 - 2009-12-19
 - Some documentation fixes.
 - Cleaned up relationship code.
 - Attempted in-item indexed relationships, but abandoned it due to race conditions. Check out commits a3c651797a5d3924be129300bf08500e0e3c6f2d and 04709b014317d9c15dc265323cde71a647e072d9 to investigate in the future.

 - Added async calls to HTTP requests for use with multitaskers like POE and Coro.
 - Fixed a bug where retries on failed connections were infinite.

0.0100 - 2009-12-17
 - Add memcached as a front-end layer to get around the eventual consistency problem.
 - Fixed the Foo problem with CPAN.
 - Fixed a few linking problems in the docs.
 - Added Crypt::SSLeay as a prereq. Forgot to it in the last release. Amazon API only works over SSL, so this is required.
 - Added Memcached::libmemcached as a prereq.
 - Added "Support" section to docs.
